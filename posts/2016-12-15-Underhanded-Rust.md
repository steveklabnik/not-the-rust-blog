title: "Announcing the First Underhanded Rust Contest"

The [Rust Community Team](https://community.rs) is pleased to announce the
first annual Underhanded Rust Contest, inspired by the [Underhanded
C](http://www.underhanded-c.org/) and [Underhanded
Crypto](https://underhandedcrypto.com/) contests. Our goal with
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is to make it easy to write trustworthy
low-level software that is resistant to accidental security vulnerabilities.
Less often challenged has been Rust's ability to protect against
*deliberate* vulnerabilities in the face of scrutiny. This challenge is
designed to put our language and [the broader Rust
ecosystem](https://crates.io/) to the test, to help us learn where our blind
spots are and what needs to be done to address them. In short, we want you to
break our stuff using reasonable, easy-to-read code. Can you write 100% safe
Rust that hides a logic bug, or hide an exploit in
[unsafe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/unsafe.html) Rust that passes an audit?
Now's your chance!
