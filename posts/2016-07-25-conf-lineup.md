The Rust Community is holding three major conferences in the near future, and we
wanted to give a shout-out to each, now that all of the lineups are fully
announced.

### Sept 9-10: RustConf

[RustConf](http://rustconf.com/) is a two-day event held in **Portland, OR,
USA** on September 9-10. The first day offers tutorials on Rust given directly
by members of the Rust core team, ranging from absolute basics to advanced
ownership techniques. The second day is the main event, with talks at every
level of expertise, covering both core Rust concepts and design patterns,
production use of Rust, reflections on the RFC process, and systems programming
in general. We offer
[scholarship](https://tilde.wufoo.com/forms/rustconf-scholarships/) for those
who would otherwise find it difficult to attend. Join us in lovely Portland and
hear about the latest developments in the Rust world!

### Sept 17-18: Rust Fest

Join us at [RustFest](http://www.rustfest.eu/), Europe's first conference
dedicated to the Rust programming language. Over the weekend 17-18th September
we'll gather in **Berlin** to talk Rust, its ecosystem and community. All day
Saturday will have talks with topics ranging from hardware and testing over
concurrency and disassemblers, and all the way to important topics like
community, learning and empathy. While Sunday has a focus on learning and
connecting, either at one of the many workshops we are hosting or in the central
meet-n-greet-n-hack area provided.

Thanks to the many awesome sponsors, we are able to offer affordable tickets to
go on sale this week, with an optional comboâ€”including both
[Viewsource](https://viewsourceconf.org/berlin-2016/) and RustFest. Keep an eye
on http://www.rustfest.eu/, get all the updates on the
[blog](http://www.rustfest.eu/blog/) and don't forget to follow us on Twitter

### Oct 27-28: Rust Belt Rust

[Rust Belt Rust](http://www.rust-belt-rust.com/) is a two-day conference in
**Pittsburgh, PA, USA** on October 27 and 28, 2016, and people with any level of
Rust experience are encouraged to attend. The first day of the conference has a
wide variety of interactive workshops to choose from, covering topics like an
introduction to Rust, testing, code design, and implementing operating systems
in Rust. The second day is a single track of talks covering topics like
documentation, using Rust with other languages, and efficient data
structures. Both days are included in the
[$150 ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rust-belt-rust-conference-registration-25729515674)!
Come learn Rust in the Rust Belt, and see how we've been transforming the region
from an economy built on manufacturing to an economy built on technology.
