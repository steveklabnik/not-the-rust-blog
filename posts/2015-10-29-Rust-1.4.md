title: "Announcing Rust 1.4"

Choo choo! The trains have kept rolling, and today, we‚Äôre happy to announce the
release of Rust 1.4, the newest stable release. Rust is a systems programming
language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

As always, you can [install Rust 1.4][install] from the appropriate page on our
website, and check out the [detailed release notes for 1.4][notes] on GitHub as
well. About 1200 patches were landed in this release.

[notes]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8ab8581f6921bc7a8e3fa4defffd2814372dcb15/RELEASES.md#version-140-october-2015

### What's in 1.4 stable

The story of 1.4 is mostly one of improvements and stabilizations, rather than
new features.

However, there is one particular change which is a language fix that enables a
new feature: [RFC 1214, ‚ÄúClarify (and improve) rules for projections and
well-formedness‚Äù](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1214). While that‚Äôs
a deeply technical title, the TL;DR is that we found some weaknesses in the
definition and implementation of a few aspects of the type system. This RFC
fixes these problems. Given that changes to the type system like this can cause
regressions, but fixes like this are important for soundness, Rust 1.4 will
warn on any code that violates the new rules, but still compile. These warnings
will turn into errors in Rust 1.5. However, given the train model, the
community has had time to deal with these changes while 1.4 was in beta, and
the small number of crates we were aware of have already been fixed.

These soundness fixes enable the return of the ‚Äòscoped threads‚Äô feature, in
which you can create threads that reference data stored on the stack in a
safe manner. A few crates have implemented this feature, most notably
[crossbeam] and [scoped_threadpool]. See their documentation for more
information.

[crossbeam]: https://crates.io/crates/crossbeam
[scoped_threadpool]: https://crates.io/crates/scoped_threadpool

[RFC 1212](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1212-line-endings.md)
is also in this release, which changes all functions dealing with reading
‚Äòlines‚Äô to treat both `\n` and `\r\n` as a valid line-ending. This was
determined during the RFC process to be a bugfix, but we‚Äôre mentioning it
here to raise awareness. The older behavior of only dealing with `\n` made
for surprising behavior, where your crate would work well on Linux and Mac OS
X, but fail on Windows. This fix brings these functions more in-line (üòâ)
with expectations.

Rust 1.4 marks an upgrade in our Windows support: Windows builds targeting the
64-bit MSVC ABI and linker (instead of GNU) are now supported and recommended
for general use, and will appear on the downloads page for the first time.
Thank you to all who have helped us work out the kinks since support initially
landed in Rust 1.2.

Here‚Äôs a summary of library changes:

* 48 APIs were stabilized.
* Eight APIs were deprecated.
* Two were made faster.
* Over ten various types implement new traits.

See the [release notes][libnotes] for exact details.

The compiler [no longer uses
`morestack`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27338), which was a
holdover implementation detail from long, long ago. We now use guard pages
and stack probes instead, though stack probes are only implemented on Windows
so far.

Finally, one major Cargo improvement: [`cargo update` will now print extra
information about what it is
changing.](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1931) For example:

```text
$ cargo update
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
    Updating libc v0.1.8 -> v0.1.10
    Updating memchr v0.1.3 -> v0.1.5
    Updating num v0.1.26 -> v0.1.27
    Updating rand v0.3.9 -> v0.3.10
    Updating rustc-serialize v0.3.15 -> v0.3.16
```

Before, it would do this job silently.
