I'm pleased to announce that Yehuda Katz and Steve Klabnik are joining
the [Rust core team]. Both of them are not only active and engaged
members of the Rust community, but they also bring a variety of skills
and experience with them.

Yehuda Katz will be known to many in the Rust community for his work
on the initial design and implementation of the Cargo project. He is
also a co-founder of [Tilde], which has been using Rust commercially
in their [Skylight] product for quite some time. Finally, he has been
heavily involved with the Ruby ecosystem (through such projects as
[Ruby on Rails] and [Bundler]) and with JavaScript as well (through
the [Ember.js] and [jQuery] frameworks and the
[TC39 language committee]).

Steve Klabnik is of course the primary author of the [Rust guide] as
well as much of Rust's documentation (not to mention independent works
like [Rust for Rubyists]). He is passionate about improving the
learnability of Rust and ensuring that the onboarding experience is
smooth. Finally, Steve is an enthusiastic and tireless
communicator. Wherever there is discussion about Rust to be found, be
it IRC, the [RFCs repo], or [Reddit]/[HackerNews], you can be sure to
find a comment or two from Steve there, explaining and clarifying the
situation.

Thanks Yehuda and Steve for all your hard work, and welcome to the core team!
