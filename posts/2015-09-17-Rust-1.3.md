The gear keeps turning: we're releasing Rust 1.3 stable today! As always, read
on for the highlights and check the [release notes][notes] for more detail.

### What's in 1.3 stable

This is our first release shipping with the
[Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/), a new book covering
"The Dark Arts of Advanced and Unsafe Rust Programming". While it's still in
draft form, this book already provides deep coverage of some of Rust's darker
corners.

On the library front, we saw a fair amount of API stabilization, including the
new `Duration` API and enhancements to `Error` and `Hash`/`Hasher`. We expect to
see further growth of the `std::time` module in the 1.5 timeframe.

The 1.3 cycle also saw continuing focus on performance. Most wins here are
within the standard library:

- The substring matcher now uses a
  [more efficient algorithm](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26327).
- There were
  [improvements to zero filling](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26849)
  that speed up `Vec::resize` and `Read::read_to_end`.
- The implementation of `Read::read_to_end` has been
  [specialized for `stdin` and `File`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26950),
  resulting in additional speedups.
- The `PartialEq` implementation on slices is now
  [much faster](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26884).

We're continuing to invest in Windows, with
[preliminary support for targeting Windows XP](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26601). While
we do not intend to treat Windows XP as a "first tier" platform, it is now
feasible to build Rust code for XP as long as you avoid certain parts of the
standard library. Work on MSVC toolchain integration is ongoing, with full
support (on 64-bit) shipping in the 1.4 beta today.

On the Cargo front, we have landed support for
[lint capping](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27260) as specified by an
[earlier RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1193). The idea is that
lints in your dependencies should not affect your ability to compile cleanly,
which in turn makes it easier to tweak the way lints work without undue hassle
in the ecosystem.
