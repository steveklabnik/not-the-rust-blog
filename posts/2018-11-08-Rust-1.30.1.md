The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.30.1. Rust is a
systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.30.1 is as easy as:

```
$ rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for
1.30.1][notes] on GitHub.

## What's in 1.30.1 stable

This patch release fixes broken Cargo progress bars in MSYS terminals on
Windows by [capping the progress bar width to 60 columns][cargo/6122]. This doesn't affect
other terminal emulators (like `cmd.exe` or PowerShell).

This patch release also [fixes a compiler panic][54199] that happened while building the
docs of some crates in Rust 1.30.0. The crates impacted were widely used, so
this change impacted a considerable amount of users, which made it sufficiently
prominent for us to issue a point release.
